 Education Script Project

This project is part of my portfolio, demonstrating my ongoing learning and development in Python.
It’s a work in progress — currently focused on improving file handling, usability, and security.

 Overview

This Python script performs various file operations and is designed to be flexible and expandable.
Future versions will include a graphical interface, multi-filetype support, and encryption.
