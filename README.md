## Education Script Project

This project is part of my portfolio, demonstrating my ongoing learning and development in Python.
It’s a work in progress — currently focused on improving file handling, usability, and security.

## To-Do List
```
>Make the file save to an actual directory, in the same one as the fucking python file ✅ 
>Open files already done with reading not just appending (make a menu or sm?) 
>Add a gui at some point potentially in tkinter
>Add support for different filetypes
>Add an encryption system
>Add a standalone release using Pyinstaller or Nuitka idk yet
>Version system maybe
>Better error handling
```
## Changelog
